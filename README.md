# SNDTools - Statistical Nuclear Data Tools
A small framework to read, validate and interact with statistical nuclear data sets.

The overall goal of the package is to provide a set of classes that allows the user to easily interact with statistical nuclear data from a variety of different experiments.

It will also contain simple programs for reading and validating data. This to ease the addition of new or modification of datasets into repositiories.
